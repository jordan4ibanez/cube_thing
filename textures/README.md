Credit for the textures go to Perttu Ahola <celeron55@gmail.com> and other developers and contributors of early versions of Minetest-c55 and Minetest Game.

Textures from that ancient era are used, if they are available. Other textures that did not exist in the ancient versions were recreated by Wuzzy in a similar style.
